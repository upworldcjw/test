CHANGES IN VERSION 4.3.1:

  This is what is supposed to happen, except that it would pick a different port for IPv4 and IPv6
  Added code to make sure both protocols are listening on the same port

Altered bits of code to match Apple's coding style guidelines

Renamed method "attachAcceptSockets" to "attachSocketsToRunLoop:error:"
